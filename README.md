# Fortune Teller - Spin the Wheel! ðŸŽ¡

Feeling indecisive? Can't decide who gets the last slice of pizza? Need to randomly assign chores to your roommates? Look no further! This **Fortune Teller Wheel** is here to save the day (or ruin it, depending on where the wheel lands). 

## Features

- **Customizable Chaos**: Add your own list of names, items, or bad decisions to the wheel.
- **Rainbow Explosion**: Each slice of the wheel gets a random color because life is too short for boring wheels.
- **Spin-tastic Animation**: Watch the wheel spin with the grace of a caffeinated squirrel.
- **Winner Winner Chicken Dinner**: The wheel will dramatically reveal the "lucky" winner. (No actual chickens are awarded.)

## How to Use

1. **Enter Your Victims**: In the text area, type in the names of your friends, enemies, or random objects. One per line, please. No cheating!
2. **Spin the Wheel**: Click the shiny refresh button in the center. Warning: The wheel has a mind of its own.
3. **Celebrate (or Cry)**: The wheel will stop, and the chosen one will be revealed. Congratulations? Maybe?

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Because the internet still runs on it.
- **CSS3**: To make it look less like a 90s website.
- **JavaScript**: The magic sauce that makes the wheel spin and breaks hearts.
- **Canvas API**: For drawing the wheel so you donâ€™t have to.

## Setup

1. Download the code. (Or just clone it if you're fancy.)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. (Pro tip: Double-click it.)
3. Start spinning and let fate decide your life choices.

## Customization

- **Change Colors**: Tweak the `randomColor()` function in `index.js` if youâ€™re feeling artsy.
- **Adjust Spin Speed**: Modify the `animate()` function if you want the wheel to spin faster than your exâ€™s new relationship.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this to decide who does the dishes?**  
A: Absolutely. Itâ€™s scientifically proven to be 100% fair. (Not really.)

**Q: What if the wheel lands on me?**  
A: Sorry, no refunds. The wheel has spoken.

**Q: Can I add more than 10 items?**  
A: Sure, but the wheel might start judging you.
